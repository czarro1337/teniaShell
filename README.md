# teniaShell - Linux Shell Recreation
teniaShell is a Python-based recreation of a Linux Shell.
Tenia is a lightweight shell highly inspired by Linux.
It isn't a Linux distro by any means, its just a recreation of a terminal shell.

# Release.

Release date will probably be somewhere around 15.07.2022


# Functions.

Basic functions like installing pip packages, opening websites, sys information etc.
You can hard-code your own commands, as teniaShell is open-source.

# Requirements.

- psutil
- platform
- datetime
- ctypes
- os
- time
- colorama
- pwinput
- win10toast

# Demo released, any future plans?

I plan on getting teniaShell something more, for example like bash, automation.
For example a user could program something in teniaShell (maybe a nano recreation soon?) and use the .tsh extension (read t-shell)
And then a user could enter tsh something.tsh and then it would show the code, just like in bash.

More functions and the code being more open to the user. Of course a dedicated Linux version coming soon.
I believe that teniaShell could be a success, being only a beginner programmer, I could make it a reality.
Of course it wouldn't be a 100% replacement for bash, zsh, etc.
And of course, when the full version releases I will try to obfuscate the code somehow.

Created a TikTok account for any little leaks and more stuff mainly teniaShell-oriented.
If you want to see the process of developing this, follow @teniashell on TikTok, very much appreciated!

What can I say? I really don't know, but with the demo I would like to know your feedback, so I can somehow polish teniaShell and in the full version, make teniaShell a 1:1 good recreation of our beloved Linux shell.

I want to say thanks to all people passing by, or downloading the demo. I appreciate every single interaction with my project.

# I want to make a teniaShell copy, can I fork it?

teniaShell is FOSS! If you give credit, you can.

# Discord?

I plan on making a community discord for teniaShell, possible discord coming soon

# why are updates on czarro1337 and not bruhlnv?

account lost sadly.
